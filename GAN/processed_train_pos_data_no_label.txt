It 's a masterpiece .
It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .
Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .
Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
Catch it ... if you can !
Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '
` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
The script is smart , not cloying .
Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .
A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
An ambitious ` what if ? '
that works .
`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
Nice piece of work .
` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
Yep , it 's `` Waking up in Reno . ''
I survived .
By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .
But it 's surprisingly harmless .
What 's next ?
The Porky 's Revenge : Ultimate Edition ?
There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
Is `` Ballistic '' worth the price of admission ?
Would I see it again ?
Please see previous answer .
It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
`` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this Cliff Notes edition is a cheat .
The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
Please .
